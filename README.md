# DBPedia-SparQL-Experiments
The following two points made me create this document: 
 - **DBPedia is versy useful:** a large resource, based on refinement of Wikipedia, very useful for NLP research. 
 - **DBPedia is a mess: ** There are a lot of information about using DBPedia spread around the web, which sometimes are erronous. I wanted something simple and handy that I can easily refer to, whenever I need to use it. 

For most this I am using the [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) query language.
